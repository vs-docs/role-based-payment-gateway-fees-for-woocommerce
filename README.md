The Role Based Payment Gateway Based Fees extension enables you to add a fee to an order, depending on the User role & the chosen payment gateway.

The fee can be automatically assessed on the price of certain products in the cart or the cart total, in addition to being changed on an order by the shop administrator at any time. A fee may also be applied manually, i.e., if the customer wants to switch payment methods after checkout is completed.

Payment gateway based fees and discounts can be added to **all payment gateways** including:

* standard WooCommerce payment gateways Direct Bank Transfer - \(BACS\), Cheque Payment, Cash on Delivery and PayPal,
* custom payment gateways added with any other plugin.
